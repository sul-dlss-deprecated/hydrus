w/ non-linear indexed role MD)

Collection View: Without javascript: Make sure Open Collection button is not 
enabled until all required fields are filled out (currently, it is enabled with 
empty form).

Move Open Collection/Close Collection button and delete collection trash icon 
and associated text to Collection View "What you can do" box from Collection 
Edit Actions box.

Collection View: "What you can do"  box should show trash icon with "Cannot 
discard collection because it contains items." label under Open Collection 
button if collection has items.

Collection and Item View pages: Improve display of main content area for both 
so that only required fields and fields with values are shown. Display 
"not specified" for required field values that are empty.

Collection Edit: Do some minor styling to add space around form elements in 
Roles section.

Item View sidebar Status box: Update so there are no empty values for displayed
fields.

Item Edit: form for a new item should be populated with default values for the 
embargo and license fields.
