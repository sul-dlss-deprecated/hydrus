RoleMD only takes two empty nodes per role.

Collection Edit integration test for roles uses index for filling out form but data added is not necessarily sequential.

Move hash/arrays from hydrus_form_helper to applicable models.

Submit relevant (or all) form data on addition of multi-valued fields (issues w/ non-linear indexed role MD)
