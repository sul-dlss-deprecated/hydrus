# Temporary to-do list as we work through varous model changes and related tests.

Collection edit: add functionality for role metadata section (and test!)
  integration tests for collection/apo role metadata
    displaying what is in fedora
    adding
    removing
		role_metadata_ds.rb: test remove_node(), but need more clarity regarding the
		desired behavior.

  need methods (and tests):   add_person?  remove_person?  add_person_with_role???
  get add_person button working (and tested)
    get remove_person working for little trash can
    administrator --> app logic: role_.yml?
    collection-manager --> APO
    item-depositor --> item object

Test to exercise the creation of a new Collection.

----------

Item edit: "Add Another Published work" button does not work if the user first
deletes all of the related published works.

Possible bug: Item edit: keyword editing does not persist??
- tests for keywords() and keywords=().
- test for insert_topic()
- refactor and test remove_node() and remove_nodes().
- integration test for topic editing

Implement Item-level contact.

----------

Validation for the new APO-related fields.

AtLeastOneValidator: tests.

White space in text fields: trim leading and trailing; but preserve interior
whitespace.

==========


local_ci task: figure out why setting Rails.env=true causes test failure on 2nd run.

Fix visibility_types in hydrus_form_helper.rb.

Assess Item and Collection controllers for test coverage.

ObjectFiles controller: destroy() lacks testing.

After webauthing:  Coll create: Initialize apo roleMetadata datastream with the collection-manager
role for the current logged-in user 

After webauthing:  Item create: Create roleMetadata datastream with the item-depositor for the
current logged-in user.
