# Temporary to-do list as we work through varous model changes and related tests.

Collection edit: add functionality for role metadata section (and test!)
  integration tests for collection/apo role metadata
  need methods (and tests):   add_person?  remove_person?  add_person_with_role???
  get add_person button working (and tested)
    get remove_person working for little trash can
    administrator --> app logic: role_.yml?
    collection-manager --> APO
    item-depositor --> item object

Test to exercise the creation of a new Collection.

Coll create: Initialize roleMetadata datastream with the collection-manager
role for the current logged-in user

----------

Convert desc_metadata_ds.rb to use template approach similar to that in
role_metadata_ds.rb.

OM tests: when we write tests using OM terms, confirm that the change goes to
correct place in XML.

Test our delegate() methods in GenericObject, Item, and AdminPolicyObject).

----------

Validation for the new APO-related fields.

AtLeastOneValidator: tests.

White space in text fields: trim leading and trailing; but preserve interior whitespace.

==========

local_ci task: figure out why setting Rails.env=true causes test failure on 2nd run.

Fix visibility_types in hydrus_form_helper.rb.

Implement Item-level contact.

(UI coding: Collection Edit: convert license test to drop-down, conditional on radio button choice.)

Confirm: When a Hydrus item is created, it should get a roleMetadata datastream
with the one item-depositor role for the current logged-in user [from Lynn].

collection.rb: unit test the getters/setters delegation to the APO. (or a sample? or skip this?)

Assess Item and Collection controllers for test coverage.

ObjectFiles controller: destroy() lacks testing.

role_metadata_ds.rb: test remove_node(), but need more clarity regarding the desired behavior.
