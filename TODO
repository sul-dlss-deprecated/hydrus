  get add_person button working (and tested)
    get remove_person working for little trash can
    administrator --> app logic: role_.yml?
    collection-manager --> APO
    item-depositor --> item object

Test to exercise the creation of a new Collection.

----------

Item edit: "Add Another Published work" button does not work if the user first
deletes all of the related published works.

Implement Item-level contact.

----------

Only allow users to create new items if the underlying collection is set to published.
Store publish state for item and collection (collection publish state stored in APO?)
Store "agree to terms" checkbox for item.
