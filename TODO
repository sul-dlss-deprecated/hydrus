# Temporary to-do list as MH and ND work through some needed model
# changes and related tests.

Collection edit: add functionality for role metadata section (and test!)
  fix borked person_role stuff in collection_edit / apo model
        need methods:   add_person?  remove_person?  add_person_with_role???
  get remove_person working for little trash can
  get add_person button working (and tested)
    administrator --> app logic: role_.yml?
    collection-manager --> APO
    item-depositor --> item object

Test to exercise the creation of a new Collection.

Coll create:
  Initialize roleMetadata datastream with the collection-manager role for the current logged-in user

----------

Set {:unique => true} for title, abstract, citation, contact. Modify tests,
views, etc as needed. Also see Consul pages (Collection and Item description)
for other unique fields.

Improve hyphen toggling methods.

Convert desc_metadata_ds.rb to use template approach similar to that in role_metadata_ds.rb.

OM tests: when we write tests using OM terms, confirm that the change goes to correct place in XML.

Test our delegate() methods in GenericObject, Item, and AdminPolicyObject).

==========

Fix visibility_types in hydrus_form_helper.rb.

Implement Item-level contact.

(UI coding: Collection Edit: convert license test to drop-down, conditional on radio button choice.)

Confirm: When a Hydrus item is created, it should get a roleMetadata datastream
with the one item-depositor role for the current logged-in user [from Lynn].

collection.rb: unit test the getters/setters delegation to the APO. (or a sample? or skip this?)

Assess Item and Collection controllers for test coverage.

ObjectFiles controller: destroy() lacks testing.

AtLeastOneValidator: is the logic correct?

role_metadata_ds.rb: test remove_node(), but need more clarity regarding the desired behavior.

White space in text fields: trim leading and trailing; but preserve interior whitespace.
