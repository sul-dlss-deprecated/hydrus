# Temporary to-do list as we work through varous model changes and related tests.

Collection edit: add functionality for role metadata section (and test!)
  integration tests for collection/apo role metadata
    displaying what is in fedora
    adding
    removing
		role_metadata_ds.rb: test remove_node(), but need more clarity regarding the
		desired behavior.

  need methods (and tests):   add_person?  remove_person?  add_person_with_role???
  get add_person button working (and tested)
    get remove_person working for little trash can
    administrator --> app logic: role_.yml?
    collection-manager --> APO
    item-depositor --> item object

----------

Coll view: Items grid: display the depositor, using Item.roleMetadata.depositor...

Item view: Submitted by: display the depositor, using Item.roleMetadata.depositor...

Item view: release date. See Consul page. Date from "published" lifecycle when it exists, else "not released" 
Display format: 31-Jan-2012.

Item view: visibility. See Consul page. Currently displayed value seems wrong.

Rationalize date format across various pages.

Test to exercise the creation of a new Collection.

Change dirty to content_will_change

----------

Item edit: "Add Another Published work" button does not work if the user first
deletes all of the related published works.

Item edit: "Links to related content" button does not work if the user first
deletes all of the related published works.

----------

Only allow users to create new items if the underlying collection is set to published.
Store publish state for item and collection (collection publish state stored in APO?)
Store "agree to terms" checkbox for item.

==========

Assess Item and Collection controllers for test coverage.

ObjectFiles controller: destroy() lacks testing.

Coll create: Initialize apo roleMetadata datastream with the collection-manager
role for the current logged-in user (waiting on web auth).

Item create: Create roleMetadata datastream with the item-depositor for the
current logged-in user (waiting on web auth).
