--------
UI Redesign
--------

After finishing more thorough UI rework, look at:
  responsive issues
  accessibility issues

Update search results page; UI redesign degraded formatting of it.

Make date format consistent (YYYY-MM-DD)

Update SUL-chrome gem to latest Bootstrap (needed to be able to use the
unchecked checkbox icon, which is not available in our current SUL-chrome gem).
When this is done, change "icon-minus" to "icon-check-empty" in the
select_status_checkbox_icon helper method (application_helper.rb).

Item View page: Fix conditional display of metadata sections when only some
required fields have been saved.

Collection Items page: Type column is temporarily commented out. Add back when
we distinguish between different item types.

--------
Roles and Discovery
--------

Change link in email notification from "hydrus.stanford.edu" to
"hydrus-test.stanford.edu"

Integration tests for role-protection and gated discovery:
  Dashboard:
    Collections shown should vary by user
  Search:
    N search results should vary by user
  Collection:
    open collection
    discard collection
    close collection
    add new Item
  Item:
    submit for approval
    discard item
    approve/disapprove/reason

Workflow changes and SOLR: when the workflow DS for an object changes, the
local SOLR index on a developer's box is not updated. Option 1: set up a
listener that will update local SOLR when objects changes on the dor-dev
environment. See dor-services-gem bin/ directory. Option 2: run the workflow
service locally.

Workflow fixtures. Create proper workflow XML fixture files, and modify rake
refresh_workflows task to load the files. We need more fine-grained controlled
over the states of our fixture objects.

person_roles=(). Prune unneeded roles. For example, if user X is a collection
manager, it's pointless to make him a lesser role like reviewer.

--------
Misc implementation tasks
--------

Update assembly robots to allow for multiple source directories

Update to latest dor-services-gem:
  - update gemfile
  - remove hydrusWF workflow definition from APO

rightsMD: (a) tests; (b) refactor to take advantage of OM and generic_ds.rb.

WAITING

Should the hydrus app be logging more systematically?

Dashboard: implement hyperlinks to items-by-status. For example, "3 published"
should be a hyperlink to the 3 published items for the applicable collection.

Item view page. The "Test Version" image in the top left corner interferes with
the user's ability to click the Collection hyperlink, especially when the
Collection has a very short title.

Collection/Item create. Rather than starting a new Item/Collection with blank
text boxes, use the approach we have adopted elsewhere for non-required items:
have the user click "Add" button first. Collection: links to related items.
Item: related citations; and links to related items.

Consider moving Hydrus::Responsible into RoleMDDS. Not sure that we need the
module.  Also, there is currently some duplication between Hydrus::Responsible
and the to_solr() method in RoleMDDS.

Need a place to store Item types. Currently hardcoded to :dataset. Also see
object_type() in GenericObject. [Lynn and Hannah will discuss]

APO RELS-EXT datastream needs to add a child node to <rdf:Description>:
<hydra:referencesAgreement rdf:resource="info:fedora/druid:XXX"/>, where XXX is
the PID of the global Hydrus Agreement object. [The Hydrus agreement object
needs to be created -- need more details].

Use reified WFs rather than putting them in the APO. (a) Set up WF objects on
-dev. (b) Work with Willy to deploy the feature to -dev.

Collection create: APO.roleMetadata: set the value of <name> for the
collection-manager [waiting on LDAP].

Collection create: APO.descMetadata. Flesh out. [waiting on spec from Lynn]

Should roleMetadata have an XML namespace? If so, what should it be? Could not
find any definitive examples in Consul. [waiting on response from Lynn]

Item view page: the actions box div is called "div.collection-actions".
[Postpone this until we have GG's new design for sidebar, etc.]
