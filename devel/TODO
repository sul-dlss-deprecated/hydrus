Item view page. The "Test Version" image in the top left corner interferes with
the user's ability to click the Collection hyperlink, especially when the
Collection has a very short title.

Item and Collect edit. When you click one of the "Add..." or "Delete..."
buttons, we should give the user some visual feedback so they don't think
nothing happened.

Add Item to Collection. Drop down does not work when javascript is disabled.
Applies to home page and Collection view page.

UI redesign: side bar and tabs.

Deployment to hydrus-test.stanford.edu is a hassle. In particular, it's not easy
to get the latest fixture/file content up-to-date.

Item.embargo datastream: create the DS, using default embargo info from APO.

descMD template. Don't start with an empty person. Related issues:
  - Item valiation. The :actors validation does not impose much of a test,
    because the xml template for descMD always includes an actor (with a blank
    role and name).
  - Item Edit: Don't a a person to the descMD if the name is left blank when
    the user saves the form

rightsMD: (a) tests; (b) refactor to take advantage of OM and generic_ds.rb.

Check test coverage in models: admin_policy_object.rb, collection.rb.

Need a place to store Item types. Currently hardcoded to :dataset. Also see
object_type() in GenericObject. [Lynn and Hannah will discuss]

APO RELS-EXT datastream needs to add a child node to <rdf:Description>:
<hydra:referencesAgreement rdf:resource="info:fedora/druid:XXX"/>, where XXX is
the PID of the global Hydrus Agreement object. [The Hydrus agreement object
needs to be created -- need more details].

Use reified WFs rather than putting them in the APO. (a) Set up WF objects
on -dev. (b) Work with Willy to deploy the feature to -dev.

Collection create: APO.roleMetadata: set the value of <name> for the
collection-manager [waiting on LDAP].

Collection create: APO.descMetadata. Flesh out. [waiting on spec from Lynn]

Should roleMetadata have an XML namespace? If so, what should it be? Could not
find any definitive examples in Consul. [waiting on response from Lynn]

Item view page: the actions box div is called "div.collection-actions".
[Postpone this until we have GG's new design for sidebar, etc.]
