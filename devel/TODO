Item edit. You can't add a description to an uploaded file when you first
upload it.  You have to click Save and go back into editing mode.

Item edit. You can't add more people.

Item view page. The "Test Version" image in the top left corner interferes with
the user's ability to click the Collection hyperlink when the Collection has a
short title.

Events: collection and item view beautification/tabification.

Item.embargo datastream: create the DS, using default embargo info from APO.

Item Edit: When adding people, if a row with no name field is present when the
form is saved, that row should not be stored at all. There is currently a bug
which occurs if you add a blank row (i.e. no no name), and then add another row
with a name and then save. Strange things happen (the role field and/or name
value is lost).

Submit relevant (or all) form data on addition of multi-valued fields (issues
w/ non-linear indexed role MD)

Coll event when an Item is added to it?

Modify roles: change 'hydrus-item-reviewer' to 'hydrus-collection-reviewer';
and change 'hydrus-item-viewer' to 'hydrus-viewer'.

rightsMD: (a) tests; (b) refactor to take advantage of OM and generic_ds.rb.

Merge, push, etc.

Implement editing events:
  write tests
    log_editing_events
    changed_fields
    old_object
    editing_event_message
    tracked_fields
    save(opts = {})
    equal_when_stripped?(v1, v2)

WAITING

Deployment to hydrus-test.stanford.edu is a hassle. In particular, it's not easy
to get the latest fixture/file content up-to-date.

Create new Collection/Item: create rightsMetadata. The rightsMetadata will
contain the Item-level license and visibility info. [Need more info: I assume
we will use Stanford-flavored rightsMetadata. Any other requirements?]

When javascript is disabled, it is not possible to add new items, because the
drop down menus don't work. Applies to home page and Collection view page.
[Postpone this until we have GG's new design for sidebar, etc.]

Item valiation. The :actors validation does not impose much of a test, because
the xml template for descMD always includes an actor (with a blank role and
name). If we care about the test, it needs to do more (or we need to modify
descMD and/or UI?). [Waiting until JK refactors handling of multi-valued
fields, Javascript, etc.]

Need a place to store Item types. Currently hardcoded to :dataset. Also see
object_type() in GenericObject. [Lynn and Hannah will discuss]

APO RELS-EXT datastream needs to add a child node to <rdf:Description>:
<hydra:referencesAgreement rdf:resource="info:fedora/druid:XXX"/>, where XXX is
the PID of the global Hydrus Agreement object. [The Hydrus agreement object
needs to be created -- need more details].

Use reified WFs rather than putting them in the APO. [Need more info on how
this works and its relative priority. Also waiting on some work Willy is doing
in dor-services.]

Collection create: APO.roleMetadata: set the value of <name> for the
collection-manager [waiting on LDAP].

Collection create: APO.descMetadata. Flesh out. [waiting on spec from Lynn]

Should roleMetadata have an XML namespace? If so, what should it be? Could not
find any definitive examples in Consul. [waiting on response from Lynn]

Item view page: the actions box div is called "div.collection-actions".
[Postpone this until we have GG's new design for sidebar, etc.]
