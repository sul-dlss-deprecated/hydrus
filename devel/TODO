--------
UI Redesign
--------

Item view page. The "Test Version" image in the top left corner interferes with
the user's ability to click the Collection hyperlink, especially when the
Collection has a very short title.

Item and Collect edit. When you click one of the "Add..." or "Delete..."
buttons, we should give the user some visual feedback so they don't think
nothing happened.

Add Item to Collection. Drop down does not work when javascript is disabled.
Applies to home page and Collection view page.

UI redesign: side bar and tabs.

-------------------
Roles/Gated Discovery
-------------------

Gated discovery strategy - dual solr queries.  Query 1 = look up APOs to find
all roles the logged in user is in. Query 2 = look up collection and item
objects and find intersection of objects with roles using permission matrix.

1. Figure out what APO role metadata to index in solr and how to index it.

2. Formulate solr pre-query.

3. Figure out how to index collection and item objects so that pre-query can
return results based on roles

4. Write module (possibly a gem using cancan as a basis?) that 

a. understands permissions and roles and is able to return true false, pass it
druid, sunet and action e.g. I am 'petucket', I am looking at
'druid:oo000oo0001' and I want to 'review' and it returns true/false

b. runs queries to return items e.g. I am 'petucket', what objects can i see?

--------
Technical Debt
--------

Deployment to hydrus-test.stanford.edu is a hassle. In particular, it's not easy
to get the latest fixture/file content up-to-date.

Unit tests. Can we improve our coverage in the controllers?

rightsMD: (a) tests; (b) refactor to take advantage of OM and generic_ds.rb.

Change roles: hydrus-viewer >> hydrus-collection-viewer (globally);
hydrus-item-depositor >> hydrus-collection-depositor (only at APO-Coll level).

****************
WAITING
****************

Need a place to store Item types. Currently hardcoded to :dataset. Also see
object_type() in GenericObject. [Lynn and Hannah will discuss]

APO RELS-EXT datastream needs to add a child node to <rdf:Description>:
<hydra:referencesAgreement rdf:resource="info:fedora/druid:XXX"/>, where XXX is
the PID of the global Hydrus Agreement object. [The Hydrus agreement object
needs to be created -- need more details].

Use reified WFs rather than putting them in the APO. (a) Set up WF objects
on -dev. (b) Work with Willy to deploy the feature to -dev.

Collection create: APO.roleMetadata: set the value of <name> for the
collection-manager [waiting on LDAP].

Collection create: APO.descMetadata. Flesh out. [waiting on spec from Lynn]

Should roleMetadata have an XML namespace? If so, what should it be? Could not
find any definitive examples in Consul. [waiting on response from Lynn]

Item view page: the actions box div is called "div.collection-actions".
[Postpone this until we have GG's new design for sidebar, etc.]

Role implementation notes
****************

Get APOs with which USER is involved. 
  :q 
    has_model_s                             info:fedora/afmodel:Hydrus_AdminPolicyObject
    roleMetadata_role_person_identifier_t   USER
  :fl
    identityMetadata_objectId_t             # APO druids.

For each APO:

  Get Collection governed by the APO.
    :q 
      has_model_s         info:fedora/afmodel:Hydrus_Item
      is_governed_by_s    info:fedora/druid:DRUID
    :fl
      identityMetadata_objectId_t     # Collection druid.
      title...                        # Collection title
  
  Print Collection title.

  Print the roles of USER.
    collection-manager
    collection-reviewer
    collection-viewer
    collection-depositor              # NOT item-depositor.
 
  For STATUS in [draft, waiting_approval, published]
      
    Determine N of items with STATUS
      :q 
        has_model_s          info:fedora/afmodel:Hydrus_Item
        is_governed_by_s     info:fedora/druid:DRUID
      :fq
        wf_wps_facet     (   hydrusAssemblyWF:STEP_A:completed
                         NOT hydrusAssemblyWF:STEP_B:completed)

    Generate link to those items.
