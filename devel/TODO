Upgrade to Rails 2.3.11+. If we upgrade to Rails 3.2.11 or higher, delete the
workaround added to the config/application.rb file to deal with a param parsing
vulnerability.

rightsMD: <access> blocks should include <none/> to indicate no access.

Move tests for workflow_ds_extension out of gen_obj_spec and into its own spec.

Consider moving Hydrus::Responsible into RoleMDDS. Not sure that we need the
module. Also, there is currently some duplication between Hydrus::Responsible
and the to_solr() method in RoleMDDS.

Item edit page: at least one person is required, so the initial edit form
should provide blank UI elements, rather than forcing user to click "Add".

--------
Other: blocked, requires discussion, uncertain need, etc.

Dashboard: implement hyperlinks to items-by-status. For example, "3 published"
should be a hyperlink to the 3 published items for the applicable collection.

Embargo, visibility, and license for draft Items under scenarios when the
collection's policies are changed from varies to fixed. Current app behavior:
if the collection allows "varies", the edit UI offers widgets; otherwise, the
Item view/edit pages display the current value for the Item. The problem
scenario: if Collection changes from varies to fixed, its unpublished items
will be "stuck" at their current value -- which might or might not agree with
the new fixed value set by the collection manager.

Move Terms of Deposit acceptance pop-up so it shows (if needed) when an item is
created.

Collection Items page: Type column is temporarily commented out. Add back when
we distinguish between different item types.

Work with Willy to switch local dev environment to use a local workflow service
rather than the workflow service on sul-lyberservices-dev.

Search results page: design could use some improvement. In addition, the
page does not provide a link back to the home page.

Assess allowing collections to be opened without being published. In effect,
this would be an open, draft Collection.

After a collection has been published, is it editable? If so, do we need to
push it through the accessioning pipeline again?

Should submit_for_approval() and resubmit() send email messages?

Should the hydrus app be logging more systematically?

Implement the ability for an admin to become some other user.

Gryphondor for Hydrus, so that Hydrus objects appear in SearchWorks.

Create object mc322hh4254 (hydra:referencesAgreement) on hydrus-dev,
hydrus-test, and hydrus-prod. [Hannah/Lynn]

Collection create: APO.roleMetadata: set the value of <name> for the
collection-manager [waiting on LDAP].

Update SUL-chrome gem to latest Bootstrap (needed to be able to use the
unchecked checkbox icon, which is not available in our current SUL-chrome gem).
When this is done, change "icon-minus" to "icon-check-empty" in the
select_status_checkbox_icon helper method (application_helper.rb).

Upgrade to hydra-head 5.0, active-fedora 5.2, OM 1.8, Solrizer 2.0, and
Blacklight 4.0. See github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Migrating-to-5.0.

When we upgrade to Nokogiri 1.5.6 we might encounter some namespace gotchas
when trying to access attributes. [See email from Jon Deering.]

Update Rubydora and incorporate rollback_fixtures() into it. See
spec_helper.rb. [We are blocked by active-fedora gem restriction to to 0.5.x
series.]

Deprecation warning: "Hydra::FileAssetsHelper has been moved". We will need to
deal with this before we move to hydra-head v5x.

The home page is producing explosive volumes of SOLR logging. This occurs
during the super() call in index() of catalog_controller.rb, which invokes a
Blacklight method that logs the entire SOLR response. A bug has been filed; in
the meantime, you can use the `rake server` task, which filters out most of the
noise. [Might be fixed when we upgrade to newer version of the hydra stack.]

XML formatting issues: (1) MODS elements should be in the default order of the
MODS spec. (2) Save the XML in some consistent pretty-print form. (3) No
useless empty elements. We attempted to make some improvement to descMetadata
using the beautify_datastream() and add_hydrus_next_sibling_node() methods;
however, the former method led to some strange behavior (for example, note the
failure of `rails runner devel/create_test_item.rb batch co i`). Further
progress probably requires some planning/discussion. The existing hydra-OM
stack does not make it easy to address all of the concerns, and several DLSS
developers expressed skepticism about the wisdom of the endeavor. If this is
truly a requirement, we should to decide the most practical place to implement
such behavior -- in every application or in a single XML-cleanup gem that all
applications could invoke.

Consider moving the actual collection-depositor roleMD info from the APO to the
Collection, for two reasons: (1) it parallels the roleMD stored in the Item;
(2) without it, we don't have access to the collection depositor during search
results (at least not without mucking with the to_solr method, which we have
done in the roleMD class).
